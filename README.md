# Lilith's Portfolio
 


## Description

My web developer portfolio, created in React.  In order to show potential employers and clients what I am capable of, my portfolio needs to showcase my skills. I'm enjoying digging deeper into what React is capable of.  

I plan to update this as time goes on.
